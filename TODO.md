# TODO

- Test error handling - getting it sorted this once should mean it's mostly
  sorted for everything else we do in the future
- Add an etcdctl command executor to the kubernetes client and refactor the test
  for the etcd cluster members
- Document things, but wait a bit until the design has settled down a bit -
  things are chruning a lot right now
